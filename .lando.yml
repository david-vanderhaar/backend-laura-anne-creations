    # Optionally allow access to the database at localhost:3307
    # You will need to make sure port 3307 is open on your machine
    #
    # You can also set `portforward: true` to have Lando dynamically assign
    # a port. Unlike specifying an actual port setting this to true will give you
    # a different port every time you restart your app
    portforward: 5444

    # Optionally set the default db credentials
    #
    # Note: You will need to `lando destroy && lando start` to change these if you've
    # already started your app
